# Evently â€” Minimal Event Management App

**Stack:** Flask (Python), SQLite, SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login, Bootstrap 5

## execution steps
1. Create Virtual Environment (only once per project)
python -m venv venv
This creates a venv folder where all your projectâ€™s packages will be stored.
(You do this only once unless you delete the folder.)

ðŸ”¹ 2. Activate Virtual Environment (every time you start working)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1


This tells VS Code/terminal to use the Python interpreter inside your projectâ€™s venv.

You must activate the venv each time you open a new terminal/session.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Install Required Packages (only once, unless new ones are needed)
pip install flask
pip install -r requirements.txt


Once installed inside your venv, they remain there until you delete venv.
No need to reinstall every time.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Run Your Project
python app.py
